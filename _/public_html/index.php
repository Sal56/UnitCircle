		<span class = indent>Building the entire unit circle by the method described here requires that we know the first three angles of the unit circle, 
			<code>30&deg;</code>, <code>45&deg;</code>,
		</span><br> and 
		<code>60&deg;</code>. We will also need to know how of convert between degrees and radians.<br><br> 
		<span class = indent>First we know that the circumference of the unit circle ( a circle of radius 1 ) is <code>2&pi;</code> radians. This comes from the formula for the 				circumference<br>
			of circle <code>C = 2&pi;r</code>, the radius of a unit circle is <code>r = 1</code>, therefore <code>C = 2&pi;1</code> so <code>C = 2&pi;</code>. A radian is, very 				simply, the measure of an arc,
		</span><br> 
		a circumference is merely the full and complete arc of a circle. The idea of a radian is the measure of an angle by the length of its arc.<br><br>
		<span class = indent>Suppose we draw a coordinate axis in x and y, then we draw a circle on this axis with a radius of one, from the x axis beginning at the origin 					we</span><br>

		draw a line at an angle of <code>30&deg;</code> that intersects the unit circle, we can get the length of the arc in radians from the relationship between the full<br>
		circumference of the circle and the degree measure of the angle. We can say that <code>30&deg;</code> is a multiplicative portion of a full circle of<br> 
		<code>360&deg;</code>. If we divide <code>360/30 = 12</code>, so <code>30&deg;</code> is a 12th of a circle. This does not tell us anything about the length of the arc 		except to say<br>
		it is 1/12 th of the full circle. We know also that the full circumference of a circle is <code>2&pi;</code> radians. We can get the length of the arc at 
		<code>30&deg;</code> by inferring a<br>
		multiplicative relationship just as we did with degree measure.<br><br> 
		<span class = indent>First we have that, <code>2&pi; = 360&deg;</code> dividing both sides by 2 we get that</span><br>
		<code>&pi; = 180&deg;</code>. We want to know how many radians are in 30&deg;. We could then next divide both sides<br>
		of <code>&pi; = 180&deg;</code> by 180&deg;<br>
		<code>&pi;/180&deg; = 180&deg;/180&deg;</code><br>
		and we get that <code>1&deg; = &pi; radians/180&deg;</code><br><br>
                                           	   
		<span class = indent>Next we would multiply both sides by 30&deg; to get the number of radians in 30&deg;, that is the length of the</span><br> 
		arc at 30&deg; of a circle.<br>
		<code>30&deg; = &pi;/180&deg; x 30&deg;/1</code><br>  		
		from this we get that;<br><br>
                               
		<code>30&deg; = &pi;/6</code><br><br>
                      		 
		and <code>45&deg; = &pi;/180&deg; x 45&deg;/1</code><br>  	
		from this we get that;<br><br>
                            		            
		<code>30&deg; = &pi;/4</code> radians<br><br>
                      		    
		and <code>60&deg; = &pi;/180&deg; x 60&deg;/1</code><br>  	
		from this we get that;<br><br>
                           		             
		<code>30&deg; = &pi;/3</code><br><br>
                      		    
		<span class = indent>We draw a line at <code>45&deg;</code>, and <code>60&deg;</code> and plot the three corresponding arc lengths. <code>&pi;/6</code> at 
			<code>30&deg;</code>, <code>&pi;/4</code> at <code>45&deg;</code>, <code>&pi;/3</code> at <code>60&deg;</code>.
		</span><br> 
		We can also infer that <code>90&deg; &pi;/2</code> since <code>180&deg;</code> is <code>&pi;</code> and mark these two points as well.<br>
		<span class = indent>So far we have <code>30 = &pi;/6</code>, <code>45 = &pi;/4</code>, <code>60 = &pi;/3</code>, <code>90 = &pi;/2</code> and <code>180 = &pi;</code>, we 				can get all the other points by this same method or we can infer some knowledge of<br> fraction and deduce the remaining radian measure points.
